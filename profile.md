### Research
**Evaluation of Reference Datasets Oriented to Single-cell Annotations**

- Designed the sampling method based on the determinantal point process and oversampling algorithm, which is able to generate high-quality reference data while keeping the original data amount.

- Implemented the method by Python and packaged code into a library with an MIT open-source license.

- Evaluated the method by comparing the automatic annotation results between original and refined datasets via several models, including Seurat, SciBet, scmap, etc.

**PhageMAP (Phage-Microbiome Assist Phagotherapy) for iGEM 2021**

- Achieved BEST Award in Software Track, iGEM 2021

- Developed phagotherapy assisting method for analyzing bacterium-phage interactions by using algorithms including CRISPRDetect, BLAST, PHP, WIsH and statistical methods including the kernel.

- Designed and implemented a relational database that stored information of bacterium, phage and bacterium-phage interactions via MySQL platform.

- Offered a user-friendly usage of analysis procedure by deploying the software environment and packages in a Docker container and uploading the container to DockerHub with instructional documentation.

- Implemented the front-end webpages using HTML/CSS/JavaScript collaboratively.
