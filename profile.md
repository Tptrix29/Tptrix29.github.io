## <u>Research</u>

**Gradient Boosting Localization Algorithm for Disease Causal Variant Identification** 				

*Columbia University Irving Medical Center*										  					   

- Packed source code into an open-source **R** library while delivering correctness verification and unit testing for the algorithm blocks.

- Refactored source code with **R6 Class** to enhance the succinctness and reproducibility of source code.
- Accelerated the running time of algorithm by optimizing linear algebra calculation process and implementing core module with **C++** library like Eigen.

**Evaluation of Reference Datasets Oriented to Single-cell Annotations**								

*Tongji University*  																					  

- Designed the sampling method based on the determinantal point process and oversampling algorithm, which can generate high-quality reference data while keeping the original data amount.
- Implemented the method by **Python** and packaged code into a library with an MIT open-source license.
- Evaluated the method by comparing the automatic annotation results between original and refined datasets via several models, including Seurat, SciBet, scmap, etc.

**PhageMAP (Phage-Microbiome Assist Phagotherapy)** 									  		

*Best Software Award in iGEM (International Genetic Engineering Machine) 2021*  								

- Developed phagotherapy assisting method for analyzing bacterium-phage interactions by using algorithms including CRISPRdetect, BLAST, PHP, WIsh and statistical methods including the kernel.
- Designed and implemented a relational database that stored information of bacterium, phage and bacterium-phage interactions via **MySQL** platform.
- Offered a user-friendly usage of analysis procedure by deploying the software environment and packages in a **Docker** container and uploading the container to DockerHub with instructional documentation.
- Implemented the front-end [webpages](https://2021.igem.org/Team:Tongji_Software) using **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** collaboratively.

## <u>Internship</u>
**Shanghai Foxhub Network Technology Company**											

*Data Engineer Intern*

- Designed relational database architecture (ER diagrams) and unstructured data source (OSS, **Object Storage Service**) on the **Alibaba Cloud** platform to support front-end webpage access.

- Managed **MySQL** database access permission and backup operation by writing **shell** scripts to maintain the stability of
  production and development environment.
